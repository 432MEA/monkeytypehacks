# Monkeytypehacks

This is a python script to simulate keyboard key presses using pyautogui.  
This script is designed for use on the website monkeytype.com  

The zip file was too large for github, so I uploaded it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ruu1mjrk3mn260/Monkeytypehacks.zip?dl=0. 
  
Requirements:

* Google Chrome browser

* Chromedriver

# Installing Chrome Browser

* Go to https://www.google.com/chrome.

* Click download. 

* Follow the instructions. 

# Installing a Chromedriver

* Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. 

* Click on the version that your google chrome browser is on. To know your version: Open google chrome. Click on the three dots in the corner. Click on help, then about Google Chrome. It should say what version your browser is on. 

* Download the file for your operating system. 

* Unzip the downloaded file to somewhere you will remember. 

# How to use  

* Download the files and unzip Monkeytypehacks. 

* Run Hacks.exe and follow the instructions. 

Right now this script supports the following typing modes on MonkeyType:

* *Custom*
  
* *Words*
  
* *Quote*
  
* *Time*

It is very simple. Just run it and follow the instructions. Just make sure that when the thing starts typing that your cursor is in the text box. Also, don't do it too fast or monkeytype will say it was an invalid test. However, as far as I know, they will not ban you.
