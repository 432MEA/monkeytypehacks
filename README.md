# How to use  

Right now this script supports the following typing modes on MonkeyType:

* *Custom*
  
* *Words*
  
* *Quote*
  
* *Time*

It is very simple. Just run it and follow the instructions. Just make sure that when the thing starts typing that your cursor is in the text box. Also, don't do it too fast or monkeytype will say it was an invalid test. However, as far as I know, they will not ban you.
